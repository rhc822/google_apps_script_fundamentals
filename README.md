# Google Apps Script Tutorial

## Tutorial
I am taking this introduction to Google Apps Script "blast off" course by [Ben Collins](https://courses.benlcollins.com/p/apps-script-blastoff), experienced data analytics instructor and freelance spreadsheet developer

## Command Line Apps Script Project [(CLASP)](https://github.com/google/clasp#status)
I made use of CLASP to work on these tutorials. This enables me to manage files using my Mac's terminal, develop using the IDE of my choice (if desired), and backup using GitHub.
